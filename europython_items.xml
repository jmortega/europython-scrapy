We are always tinkering, trying to make things better, and striving to remove antipatterns from our code and our development processes. </value><value>Yet for some reason we have not been as good at applying this spirit of optimisation to the problem of increasing diversity, even though most people these days agree that, like good tests, agile methodologies, and virtual environments, diversity is a “good thing”.</value><value>My position is that just as there is no single easy way to write good code there is no single easy way to increasing diversity. There are, however, several things that companies and organisations do which actually work against diversity. This talk will explore these antipatterns for diversity, including uncritical belief in meritocracy, lack of understanding of the realities of marginalisation, null processes, misunderstanding of “culture fit”, and an unwillingness to change, as well as some ways that teams, companies, and organisations might work to combat them.</value></description><tags><value>Best Practice</value><value>diversity</value><value>community</value><value>inclusion</value></tags><title><value>Antipatterns for Diversity</value></title></item><item><date><value>Thursday 23 July</value></date><author><value>Carrie Anne Philbin</value></author><description><value>The problem of introducing children to programming and computer science has
seen growing attention in the past few years. Initiatives like Raspberry
Pi, Code Club, code.org, (and many more) have been created to help solve
this problem. With the introduction of a national computing curriculum in
the UK, teachers have been searching for a text based programming language
to help teach computational thinking as a follow on from visual languages
like Scratch.</value><value>The educational community has been served well by Python, benefiting from
its straight-forward syntax, large selection of libraries, and supportive
community. Education-focused summits are now a major part of most major
Python Conferences. Assistance in terms of documentation and training is
invaluable, but perhaps there are technical means of improving the
experience of those using Python in education. Clearly the needs of
teachers and their students are different to those of the seasoned
programmer. Children are unlikely to come to their teachers with
frustrations about the Global Interpreter Lock! But issues such as
usability of IDEs or comprehensibility of error messages are of utmost
importance.</value><value>In this keynote, Carrie Anne will discuss existing barriers to Python
becoming the premier language of choice for teaching computer science, and
how learning Python could be helped immensely through tooling and further
support from the Python developer community.</value></description><tags><value>python</value></tags><title><value>Keynote: Designed for Education: A Python Solution</value></title></item><item><date><value>Friday 24 July</value></date><author><value>Florian Wilhelm</value></author><description><value>The author  shows how to use the </value><value>SleekXMPP</value><value> library in order to write a small chatbot that connects to Google Hangouts and reminds you or someone else to take medication for instance.

Innocents NameErrors or hard-to-find bugs with variables used in a closure, but defined in a loop, they all stand no chance in front of Pylint (http://pylint.org/).
In this talk, I’ll present one of the oldest static analysis tools for Python, with emphasis on what it can do to understand your Python code.  Pylint is both a style checker, enforcing PEP 8 rules, as well as a code checker in the vein of pyflakes and the likes, but its true power isn’t always obvious to the eye of beholder.  It can detect simple bugs such as unused variables and imports, but it can also detect more complicated cases such as invalid arguments passed to functions, it understands the method resolution order of your classes and what special methods aren’t implemented correctly. Starting from abstract syntax trees, we’ll go through its inference engine and we’ll see how Pylint understands the logical flow of your program and what sort of type hinting techniques are used to improve its inference, including PEP 484 type hints. As a bonus, I’ll show how it can be used to help you port your long-forgotten library to Python 3, using its new –py3k mode.</value></description><tags><value>static-analysis</value><value>lint</value><value>typehinting</value><value>ast</value></tags><title><value>12 years of Pylint  (or How I learned to stop worrying about bugs)</value></title></item><item><date><value>Tuesday 21 July</value></date><author><value>Stefan Baerisch</value></author><description><value>Do you know what your application did last night? Python logging can help you.</value><value>This talk you will show you how to implement a systematic logging approach without boilerplate code and how to set up the Python logging module for different needs in production systems.  We will see how to  work with log files and other logging endpoints.  We will address the data protection concerns that come up when logging  from application with personal  information. We will also look at the performance implications of logging. We will then cover best practices - how to structure logging, what to include in a log message, and how to configure logging for different use cases.</value><value>We will use the Python standard logging module to implement logging.  This talk is useful to beginners with some experience.  An understanding of decorators is useful, but not required.

Following the agile and lean approach this value created by code changes should be continuously delivered as fast, as early and as often as possible without any compromise on the quality. 
Remarkably, there is a huge gap between the development of the application code and the reliable and scalable operation of the application. As an example, most of the tutorials about web development with Flask or Django end by starting a local “dummy” server, missing out all the steps needed for production ready operation of the web service. Furthermore, as there is no “rocket science” in-between, many proposals to bridge that gap from both sides, operations and developers start with sentences like: “you just have to…”, a clear indication that it will cause problems later on and also a symptom of a cultural gap between developers and operations staff.
In this talk I will go through the complete delivery pipeline from application development to the industrial grade operation, clearly biased towards the “DevOps” mindset. Instead of presenting a sophisticated enterprise solution, I will outline the necessary building blocks for continuous delivery and fill them up with simple but working poor man’s solutions, so that it is equally useful for professional and non-professional developers and operations engineers. After the talk you will know how to build such a continuous delivery pipeline with open-source tools like “Ansible”, “Devpi” and “Jenkins” and I will share some of my day-to-day experiences with automation in general. Although many of the concepts are language agnostic I will focus on the ins and outs in a python universe and outline the pythonic way of “get this thing running”.</value></description><tags><value>Operations</value><value>ApplicationLifecycle</value><value>ConfigurationManagement</value><value>Devpi</value><value>ContinuousDelivery</value><value>DevOps</value><value>ansible</value><value>Jenkins</value></tags><title><value>A Pythonic Approach to Continuous Delivery</value></title></item><item><date><value>Wednesday 22 July</value></date><author><value>Giuseppe Cammarota</value></author><description><value>Removing UneXploded Ordnance (UXO) from minefields at the end of a conflict is a very time-consuming and expensive operation.

Concurrency is one of those cases when people look for an alternative. It’s actually what happened at the start-up I work at before I joined. The co-founders looked for a solution in a functional programming language and chose to use Clojure. Functional programming is now implemented in most programming languages and functional languages are getting more and more popular. For a junior developer learning a functional language as her/his second programming language completely make sense and I was up for the challenge! Clojure is not so different from Python in its readability and might be one of the easiest functional languages to learn for a Pythonista. I would like to share my tips and tools I used for learning and contributing to a code base in Clojure.</value><value>There are several online resources to understand the paradigm of functional programming. The same can be said regarding Clojure but a good way to learn aside from diving into a codebase is to take part in a community. The Clojurians are much fewer than the Pythonistas but they are equally friendly. They are looking forward to grow their community and their meetups and dojos are well suited to beginners. At some point you have to throw yourself into this sea of parentheses so you’d better be well equipped! In that aim Emacs is by far the best suited text editor. After customising it with the right tools you shall fear no orphan parens!
This experience will help you progress and focus on writing more concise code with short and clear functions. You will be more comfortable and curious about implementing the functional features of the Python language. Getting always closer to the Zen of Python: " Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. Readability counts. ….

Machine learning functionalities are actionable from on-line graphs, such as biclustering panels in which subset of retails and sales categories can be interactively selected. Currently 250 million entries are managed from the sales stream within the system. Network analysis (detection of community structure and co-occurrence patterns) combined with geospatial and socio-economic data are being developed as strategic tools.</value><value>The system is implemented as a web-based Django framework deployed on a AWS machine, using Celery and Redis to distribute tasks. This scalable framework can be accessed through a web interface from the strategic marketing and R&amp;D departments and other directive figures; a similar and leaner interface is available for the individual POS owners. The web interface integrates Javascript libraries to obtain interactive displays connecting machine learning and data exploration (D3js, Highcharts, Sigma.js, Heatmap.js, leaflet, InCHlib). In particular we fork the django-highchart repository to improve functionalities available for the Django framework. Actionable dendrogram structures and sunburst plots allow the handling of big taxonomies typical of the category managment reference structures. Internally, the statistical machine learning methods are deployed as stored procedures for a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database, powered by the PL/R and PL/Python extensions. </value></description><tags><value>visualization</value><value>postgresql</value><value>data-science</value><value>python</value><value>predictions</value><value>django</value><value>R</value><value>machine-learning</value></tags><title><value>Actionable data analytics in retail marketing analysis</value></title></item><item><date></date><author><value>Ludovic Gasc</value></author><description><value>Via several examples, this poster will present you how to handle quickly AsyncIO and how to build applications with </value><value>toolbox libraries</value><value> around AsyncIO.</value><value>You can create HTTP servers with AsyncIO, but also you can mixin several others server protocols like WebSockets, SSH, IRC, FastAGI or SIP.</value><value>This poster will show you that it can be easier to do than you think, AsyncIO ecosystem is beginner friendly.</value></description><tags><value>HTTP</value><value>aiohttp</value><value>aiopg</value><value>redis</value><value>servers</value><value>websockets</value><value>multi-processing</value><value>python3</value><value>asyncio</value></tags><title><value>AsyncIO ecosystem</value></title></item><item><date><value>Tuesday 21 July</value></date><author><value>Sidnei da Silva</value></author><description><value>Workshop time: 2:00pm - 7:00pm</value><value>This is a half-day version of the SRE Classroom event that has been run successfully at Google offices and conferences around the world.

Tools for optimization, however, have not changed much in the past 40 years – until very recently. The abundance of parallel computing resources has stimulated a shift away from using reduced models to solve statistical and predictive problems, and toward more direct methods for solving high-dimensional nonlinear optimization problems.</value><value>This tutorial will introduce modern tools for solving optimization problems – beginning with traditional methods, and extending to solving high-dimensional non-convex optimization problems with highly nonlinear constraints. We will start by introducing the cost function, and it’s use in local and global optimization. We will then address how to monitor and diagnose your optimization convergence and results, tune your optimizer, and utilize compound termination conditions. This tutorial will discuss building and applying box constraints, penalty functions, and symbolic constraints. We will then demonstrate methods to efficiently reduce search space through the use of robust optimization constraints.  Real-world inverse problems can be expensive, thus we will show how to enable your optimization to seamlessly leverage parallel computing. Large-scale optimizations also can greatly benefit from efficient solver restarts and the saving of state. This tutorial will cover using asynchronous computing for results caching and archiving, dynamic real-time optimization, and dimensional reduction. Next we will discuss new optimization methods that leverage parallel computing to perform blazingly-fast global optimizations and n-dimensional global searches. Finally, we will close with applications of global optimization in statistics and quantitative finance.</value><value>The audience need not be an expert in optimization, but should have interest in solving hard real-world optimization problems.  We will introduce the </value><value>mystic</value><value> optimization framework – then begin with a walk through some introductory optimizations, learning how to build confidence in understanding your results. By the end of the tutorial, participants will have working knowledge of how to use modern constrained optimization tools, how to enable their solvers to leverage high-performance parallel computing, and how to utilize legacy data and surrogate models in statistical and predictive risk modeling.</value><value>PREREQUISITES</value><value>: This tutorial will assume attendees have basic knowledge of </value><value>python</value><value> and </value><value>numpy</value><value>, and is intended for scientific developers who are interested in utilizing optimization to solve real-world problems in statistics, quantitative finance, and predictive sciences.

Although transducers are actually pretty straightforward in retrospect, wrapping your brain around them can be challenging. </value><value>Transducers allow us to fuse multiple data processing operations together so they can be applied in a single pass over a data series – similar to how Python generator functions allow us to process iterable series.  However, unlike generator functions they are completely decoupled from the data series abstraction and can be used on eager sequences, lazy iterables, coroutine-based push events and events such as those modelled by Reactive Extensions for Python (RxPy). </value><value>In this workshop, we introduce transducers by implementing them from scratch in Python 3. We’ll start with the familiar staples of functional programming, map(), filter() and reduce(), and derive transducers from first principles. We’ll work towards a set of general tools which works with eager collections, lazy ‘pull’ sequences, and coroutine ‘push’ event streams and RxPy. Along the way we’ll cover stateful transducers and transducer composition, demonstrating that transducers are both more general, and more fundamental, than the functional programming tools baked into Python and many other languages.</value><value>There are no prerequisites for this workshop as we stick to core Python 3 language features although an enthusiasm for a functional programming style will be sure to help attendees get the most out of this session.</value></description><tags><value>python</value><value>fun</value><value>Functional Programming</value><value>functional</value></tags><title><value>Functional Programming with Transducers in Python</value></title></item><item><date><value>Thursday 23 July</value><value>Thursday 23 July</value></date><author><value>Francesco Pierfederici</value></author><description><value>This tutorial explores some real-world  solutions to make your Python code run on different processes, possibly on different computers. </value><value>Tools like Pyro, Celery, Python-RQ  will be discussed.

knowledge in the field of optimization is required.</value><value>Objectives</value><value>: This tutorial will help you to get the most out of your optimization work.
You will learn useful techniques for details combined with an overall strategy
for the big picture.</value><value>Detailed Abstract</value><value>: Python is a great language. But it can be slow compared to other languages for certain types of tasks. If applied appropriately, optimization may reduce program runtime or memory consumption considerably. But this often comes at a price. Optimization can be time consuming and the optimized program may be more complicated. This, in turn, means more maintenance effort. How do you find out if it is worthwhile to optimize your program? Where should you start?
This tutorial will help you to answer these questions. You will learn how to find  an optimization strategy based on quantitative and objective criteria.
You will experience that one’s gut feeling what to optimize is often wrong.</value><value>The solution to this problem is: „Measure, Measure, and Measure!“. You will
learn how to measure program run times as well as profile CPU and memory.
There are great tools available. You will learn how to use some of them.
Measuring is not easy because, by definition, as soon as you start to measure,
you influence your system. Keeping this impact as small as possible is
important. Therefore, we will cover different measuring techniques.</value><value>Furthermore, we will look at algorithmic improvements. You will see that the
right data structure for the job can make a big difference. Finally, you will
learn about different caching techniques.</value><value>More Info</value><value>: You will need Python 2.7 or 3.4 installed on your laptop. Python 2.6 or 3.3 should also work. Very detailed installation instructions will be given to all participants well before the course.</value></description><tags><value>optimization</value><value>profiling</value></tags><title><value>Faster Python Programs - Measure, don't Guess</value></title></item><item><date><value>Monday 20 July</value><value>Monday 20 July</value></date><author><value>Harry Percival</value></author><description><value>New to Python?

They reduce the amount of work needed to make requests and sometimes, only sometimes prevent the developer from dealing with extensive documentations. It’s common to encounter libs that require not only the study of their own documentation, but also the APIs one, duplicating the needed work. This is caused because wrappers do not follow a design pattern, each developer creates it’s own design, coding style and use their preferred tools.   </value><value>Tapioca</value><value> is what can be called: “a wrapper generator”. Creating API wrappers with Tapioca is extremely easy and fast. For example, it took 1 hour to write the full wrapper for the </value><value>Parse.com</value><value> REST API. But this is not the more important thing, Tapioca libs have a similar interface so once understood how they work, developers can work with any other without the need to learn a new interface.    </value><value>Tapioca is also thought to comply with REST features and takes HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the engine of application state) seriously, so “following” links and pagination are natively supported.

Even though such unit tests may apparently cover all the code in a function, they might cover only a small subset of behaviours of the function. This potentially allows bugs such as heartbleed to stay undetected. Dynamic unit tests using fuzzing, which allows you to specify a data generation template, can make your test suite more robust.</value><value>In this talk, we demonstrate fuzzing using the hypothesis library.
Hypothesis is a Python library to automatically generate test data based on a template.
Data is generated using a strategy. A strategy specifies how data is generated, and how falsifying examples can be simplified. Hypothesis provides strategies for Python’s built-in data types, and is easily customizable.Since test data is generated automatically, we can not compare against pre-computed results. Instead, tests are usually done on invariants of functions. We give an overview of such invariants.</value><value>Finally, we demonstrate how we use fuzzing to test machine learning algorithms at Blue Yonder.</value></description><tags><value>unit-testing</value><value>hypothesis</value><value>fuzzing</value></tags><title><value>What's the fuzz all about?

Standard tools like </value><value>cProfile</value><value> and most all third party tools (like </value><value>Python Tools</value><value> plugin for Microsoft Visual Studio) suffer from common flaws.  First, the profiling overhead is high (up to 50%).  Second, the  information provided is “function-level” i.e. the  tool shows how much time was spent within a function, but not actionable “line-level” information to show which exact lines are </value><value>the bottleneck</value><value> in a function.  Adding “line-level” information to most tools causes the application to run even slower. Third, some tools require modification of the application source code to enable profiling thus disrupting development.</value><value>This talk presents an experimental Python profiler.  It typically has less than 15% overhead, shows line-level information and does not require modification of application source code.  Experiments using it resulted in performance gains of 2x and more.

Non-Blocking IO while doing tasks and not wait for IO. This also helps us handle a lot many connections than we possibly could with Blocking IO.

As data and systems grow more complex, moving and querying becomes more difficult. Python already has excellent tools for in-memory datasets, but we inevitably want to scale this processing and take advantage of additional hardware. This is where Blaze comes in handy by providing a uniform interface to a variety of technologies and abstractions for migrating and analyzing data. Supported backends include databases like Postgres or MongoDB, disk storage systems like PyTables, BColz, and HDF5, or distributed systems like Hadoop and Spark. </value><value>This talk will introduce the Blaze ecosystem, which includes: Blaze (data querying), Odo (data migration), Dask (task scheduler), DyND (dynamic, multidimensional arrays) and Datashape (data description).</value><value>Attendees will get the most out of this talk if they are familiar with NumPy and Pandas, have intermediate Python programming skills, and/or experience with large datasets.</value></description><tags><value>open-source</value><value>datashape</value><value>Abstractions</value><value>distributed-systems</value><value>pydata</value><value>odo</value><value>bigdata</value><value>analytics</value><value>dynd</value><value>blaze</value><value>databases</value><value>spark</value><value>data</value><value>numpy</value><value>dask</value></tags><title><value>Scale your data, not your process: Welcome to the Blaze ecosystem</value></title></item><item><date><value>Monday 20 July</value></date><author><value>Hitul Mistry</value></author><description><value>In this talk, people will get introduced to python threading and multiprocessing packages.

By default, we use Ruby and Rails for projects. We also use Ruby-based projects for much of our tooling, including puppet, capistrano, and rake. However, we strongly believe in using the right tool for the job. What that means has evolved over ti
me, and I’ll discuss what solutions we chose in the past as well as our current choices.</value><value>So what’s it like doing Python at a Ruby shop? You get lots of jokes about language features Ruby has but Python lacks and lots of disbelief that Python will survive the 2/3 split. People also tend to apply the best practices and conventions of Ruby to Python code as if t
hey were the same. Python’s major inroad at Braintree has been, surprisingly enough, as a platform for high-concurrency situations. This is a direct result of the power of Tornado as a platform for asynchronous I/O. It also helps that many Python is very approachable and 
many developers have at least some experience with it.</value><value>Braintree has three pieces of our infrastructure using Python and Tornado – an incoming request proxy; an outgoing request proxy; and a webook delivery service. They’ve served us well for 3+ years but all suffer from a number of problems. The outdated concurrency feature
s of CPython / Python 2 as well as our lack of experience with and commitment to Tornado have always been an issue. As the meat of the talk, I’ll speak in depth about the other issues we’ve encountered with each of the three applications and our short- and long- term solu
tions to the problems.</value><value>The state as of the end of 2014 appeared dire for Python at Braintree. All the old Python code in our stack is on the way out, and Python has been specifically recommended agaist for new projects. Our Python client library is used by some of our largest merchants, and is 
ready for the future by supporting Python 2.6+ and Python 3.3+ in a single codebase. We also have a vibrant Python community at Venmo, our sister company. Both Braintree and Venmo support Python by attending, hosting, sponsoring, and speaking at meetups, conferences, and 
other events in Chicago, New York, and elsewhere. At Braintree, our Data Science team uses Python almost exclusively and they’re becoming a bigger part of our business every day. We also use Collings and custom tooling written in Python to manage our infrastructure.</value></description><tags><value>data-science</value><value>pika</value><value>tornado</value><value>case study</value><value>collins</value><value>pandas</value><value>sklearn</value></tags><title><value>Python Not Recommended</value></title></item><item><date><value>Tuesday 21 July</value></date><author><value>Marc-Andre Lemburg</value></author><description><value>Python focuses a lot on writing readable code and also tries to make solutions obvious, but this doesn’t necessarily mean that you cannot write unreadable code or design your code in ways which makes it hard to extend or maintain.</value><value>This talk will show some useful idioms to use when writing Python code, how to structure your modules and also goes into details on which techniques to use and which to think about twice, based on 20 years of experience writing Python.</value></description><tags><value>Best Practice</value><value>python</value><value>idioms</value><value>Coding</value><value>experience</value><value>design</value></tags><title><value>Python idioms to help you write good code</value></title></item><item><date><value>Wednesday 22 July</value></date><author><value>Alejandro Garcia</value></author><description><value>An overview of the currently available Python game development libraries and frameworks and how is Python currently being used in the videogame industry.</value><value>Presentation of Kobra, a modern open source Python game development framework with ECS (Entity Component System) architecture and C++ bindings.</value></description><tags><value>python</value><value>gamedev</value><value>c++</value><value>OpenGL</value></tags><title><value>Python Gamedev MLG</value></title></item><item><date><value>Monday 20 July</value></date><author><value>Benoît Calvez</value></author><description><value>Before its first major version, Elasticsearch was only used as a “secondary” database, and search engine.

It
is responsible for scheduling, distribution and monitoring applications which

cluster.</value><value>This Talk will give an overview of PySpark with a focus on Resilient
Distributed Datasets and the DataFrame API. While Spark Core itself is written
in Scala and runs on the JVM, PySpark exposes the Spark programming model to
Python. It defines an API for Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs). RDDs are a
distributed memory abstraction that lets programmers perform in-memory
computations on large clusters in a fault-tolerant manner. RDDs are immutable,
partitioned collections of objects. Transformations construct a new RDD from a
previous one. Actions compute a result based on an RDD. Multiple computation steps
are expressed as directed acyclic graph (DAG). The DAG execution model is 
a generalization of the Hadoop MapReduce computation model.</value><value>The Spark DataFrame API was introduced in Spark 1.3. DataFrames envolve Spark’s
RDD model and are inspired by Pandas and R data frames. The API provides
simplified operators for filtering, aggregating, and projecting over large
datasets. The DataFrame API supports diffferent data sources like JSON
datasources, Parquet files, Hive tables and JDBC database connections.</value><value>Resources:</value></description><tags><value>analytics</value><value>data-science</value><value>bigdata</value><value>distributed-systems</value></tags><title><value>PySpark - Data processing in Python on top of Apache Spark.</value></title></item><item><date><value>Friday 24 July</value></date><author><value>roy simkes</value></author><description><value>Scalability is a big problem for everyone who wants to grow.

Multibody simulation (MBS) requires two major steps: first the formulation of the specific mechanical problem. Second step is the integration of the resulting equations.
For the first step we use the package sympy which is on a very advanced level to perform symbolic calculation and which supports already Lagrange’s and Kane’s formalism. The extensions we made are such that a complex mechanical setup can be formulated easily with several lines of python code. The functionality is analogous to well known MBS-tools, with that you can assemble bodies, joints, forces and constraints. Also external forces even in a cosimulation model can be added on top.

“La metaprogramación consiste en escribir programas que escriben o manipulan otros programas (o a sí mismos) como datos, o que hacen en tiempo de compilación parte del trabajo que, de otra forma, se haría en tiempo de ejecución. Esto permite al programador ahorrar tiempo en la producción de código.”
En esta charla veremos diferentes mecanismos que Python proporciona como:
 - Decoradores
 - Metaclasses
 - Descriptors
A través de varios ejemplos veremos como reutilizar código en varias funciones y clases, como modificar como nuestras clases se generan, como se genera una clase (que funciones se llaman cuando una clase se crea) o como se genera una instancia.
Veremos también que fácilmente se nos puede ir de las manos y como utilizar con cuidado las herramientas que Python nos proporciona.</value></description><tags><value>python</value><value>metaclass</value><value>metaprogramming</value></tags><title><value>Metaprogramación en Python</value></title></item><item><date><value>Tuesday 21 July</value></date><author><value>Tibor Arpas</value></author><description><value>Users and developers especially, hate waiting.

Verified fakes solve this problem.
Verified fakes allow for simplified testing using fakes while still providing the assurance that code tested using a fake implementation will behave the same way when used with a real implementation.</value><value>The talk will begin with a case-study, demonstrating what it means to write a “verified fake” implementation of a public API.
I will show how to write tests that verify a fake implementation of a well defined API
and I will show how those same tests can be re-used to verify and test real implementations of the same API.</value></description><tags><value>Best Practice</value><value>Testing</value><value>AWS</value><value>tdd</value><value>api</value><value>linux</value><value>OpenStack</value><value>docker</value><value>cloud</value></tags><title><value>Faking It - The Art of Testing Using Verified Fakes</value></title></item><item><date><value>Friday 24 July</value></date><author><value>Jan Pazdziora</value></author><description><value>When applications get deployed in enterprise environment or in large organizations, they need to support user accounts and groups that are managed externally, in existing directory services like FreeIPA or Active Directory, or federated via protocols like SAML. While it is possible to  add support for these individual setups and protocols directly to application code or to Web frameworks or libraries, often it is better to delegate the authentication and identity operations to a frontend server and just assume that the application has to be able to consume results of the external authentication and identity lookups.</value><value>In this talk, we will look at Django Web framework and how with few small changes to the framework and to the application we can extend the functionality of existing RemoteUserMiddleware and RemoteUserBackend to consume users coming from enterprise identity management systems. We will focus on using proven OS-level components such as SSSD for Web applications, but will also show setup using federation.</value></description><tags><value>web</value><value>HTTP</value><value>sssd</value><value>django</value><value>authentication</value><value>Apache</value><value>FreeIPA</value></tags><title><value>External authentication for Django projects</value></title></item><item><date><value>Friday 24 July</value></date><author><value>Rob Collins</value></author><description><value>So often, we’ve been encouraged to be smart in our development. “Work smarter not harder!” say the encouraging posters. But the desire to be smart, and be seen to be smart, is hurting. The design suffers, the code suffers, and it’s hard to recruit developers smart enough to cope with the problems caused.</value><value>In this talk, I’m proposing an alternative to being smart: </value><value>DumbDev</value><value>. Let’s use our brains for enjoyable, interesting things, rather than wrestling with code written for smart developers.</value><value>So what do I mean by </value><value>dumb</value><value>?</value><value>Well, I don’t mean ‘ignorant’. A clever person can be ignorant of some important information, and learn it. With ignorance, there is hope. I’m also not talking about its opposite, ‘stupidity’. This occurs when someone is given the information or advice, and chooses to ignore it. Dumb isn’t stupid. Nor is it silent, as in someone who can’t speak.</value><value>Instead, the picture I have is of one of the early computers: very small RAM, disk space measured in KB, and a woefully inadequate CPU. In other words, slow, with very little working memory and limited persistent storage. Hey, this describes my brain – and I realise that’s an asset! I will write better software if I take this into account.</value><value>Here’s the first </value><value>DumbDev</value><value> rule, putting a sensible limit on complexity:</value><value>1.

The tools that we use (version control systems, IDEs, code analyzers) also use text as the primary storage format for code. In fact, the belief that “code is text” is so deeply ingrained in our heads that we never question its validity or even become aware of the fact that there are other ways to look at code.</value><value>In my talk I will explain why treating code as text is a very bad idea which actively holds back our understanding and creates a range of problems in large software projects. I will then show how we can overcome (some of) these problems by treating and storing code as data, and more specifically as a graph. I will show specific examples of how we can use this approach to improve our understanding of large code bases, increase code quality and automate certain aspects of software development.</value><value>Finally, I will outline my personal vision of the future of programming, which is a future where we no longer primarily interact with code bases using simple text editors.

While these modules are probably preferable to parsing sys.argv yourself, you might wonder if there are more satisfactory solutions outside of the standard library.

We wanted to use as much of SQLAlchemy as possible, but we quickly found that the ORM (Object Relational Mapper) is not suitable for handling large amounts of data at once. At the same time, we did not want each team of developers working on individual business domains to have to handcraft their own SQL statements. To solve this problem, we built an application configuration that closely resembles an SQLAlchemy model, but also contains application-specific logic settings.</value><value>In this talk I will demonstrate:</value><value>an application architecture for multiple business domains</value><value>the structure of the domain configuration utilized in the generation of the SQLAlchemy model, SQLAlchemy core statements, and other application functionality</value><value>how the domain configuration is used throughout the application (consuming and parsing incoming data, storing it in a database and ensuring data quality)</value></description><tags><value>SQLAlchemy</value><value>bigdata</value></tags><title><value>Building a multi-purpose platform for bulk data using sqlalchemy</value></title></item><item><date><value>Tuesday 21 July</value></date><author><value>Cosmin Poieana</value></author><description><value>Bring the continuous integration to a new level, through a platform/project independent framework able to give you unittest-like reports.

The project was public before that under the name “tulip”. asyncio is just a core network library, it requires third party library to be usable for common protocols. One year later, asyncio has a strong community writing libraries on top of it.</value><value>The most advanced library is aiohttp which includes a complete HTTP client but also a HTTP server. There are also libraries to access asynchronously the file system, resolve names with DNS, have variables local to tasks, read-write locks, etc. There are clients for AMQP, Asterisk, ElasticSearch, IRC, XMPP (Jabber), etc. (and even an IRC server!). There are asynchronous drivers for all common databases, and even for some ORMs. As expected, there are tons of new web frameworks based on asyncio. It’s also possible to plug asyncio into Gtk, Qt, gevent, eventlet, gunicorn, tornado, etc.</value><value>I will also discuss use cases of asyncio in production and benchmarks. Spoiler: asyncio is not slow.</value><value>The asyncio library also evolved to become more usable: it has a better documentation, is easier to debug and has a few new functions. There is also a port to Python 2: trollius.</value></description><tags><value>networking</value><value>python3</value><value>aiohttp</value><value>asyncio</value></tags><title><value>asyncio community, one year later</value></title></item><item><date><value>Friday 24 July</value></date><author><value>Scott Triglia</value></author><description><value>The potential upside of microservices is significant and exciting. So much so that Yelp’s Transaction Platform committed from the start to an architecture of small, cooperative microservices. This talk explores the inevitable complications that arise for Python developers in as the services grow larger and stretch both their own architecture and the developers responsible for them. Come hear tales of terror (tight coupling! low test coverage!), stories which will warm your heart (agility! strong interfaces!), and everything in between as we follow the adventures of our plucky team.</value><value>The talk will be focused on the functional, cultural, and reliability challenges which occur as a microservices-based project evolves and expands over time. Particular attention will be paid to where these diverge from the utopian way microservices are often described, and to the particular difficulties faced by Python developers trying to implement such systems. My goal is to share with attendees some mistakes we’ve made, some successful methods for growing gracefully, and Python-specific tools/libraries which can help with these problems.</value><value>To enjoy this talk, you should be aware of the basic vocabulary and concepts of HTTP-based services. Any additional awareness of distributed systems (and their failure modes) will be helpful.</value></description><tags><value>services</value><value>distributed-systems</value><value>HTTP</value></tags><title><value>Arrested Development - surviving the awkward adolescence of a microservices-based application</value></title></item><item><date><value>Thursday 23 July</value></date><author><value>Rafał Nowicki</value></author><description><value>Talk about mistakes we made and best practises we have elaborated while implementation Behave Driven Development into one of the projects.

But what exactly is Big Data ? Can we, Pythonistas, enter the wonder world of Big Data ? The answer is definitely “Yes”.</value><value>This talk is an introduction to the big data processing using Apache Hadoop and Python. We’ll talk about Apache Hadoop, it’s concepts, infrastructure and how one can use Python with it. We’ll compare the speed of Python jobs under different Python implementations, including CPython, PyPy and Jython and also discuss what Python libraries are available out there to work with Apache Hadoop.</value><value>This talk is intended for beginners who want to know about Hadoop and Python or those who are already working with Hadoop but are wondering how to use it with Python or how to speed up their Python jobs.</value></description><tags><value>jython</value><value>cpython</value><value>bigdata</value><value>hadoop</value><value>PyPy</value><value>etl</value></tags><title><value>Big Data with Python &amp; Hadoop</value></title></item><item><date><value>Monday 20 July</value></date><author><value>Igor Davydenko</value></author><description><value>Times changed, with introducing asyncio to Python standard library many and many developers think about switching from previous solutions to aio stack.

The VM architecture has been designed to be VM platform agnostic and to provide disk replication and high availability.</value><value>The University of Cambridge central IT services (http://www.ucs.cam.ac.uk/) also provides other services to the rest of the university like domain name registration, authentication, authorisation, TLS certificates, etc. We link all these other services with the hosting service by using APIs while keeping a microservices architecture approach. Thus, enabling the use/link of other services  within the same hosting service web application. </value></description><tags><value>celery</value><value>ansible</value><value>hosting</value><value>cloud</value><value>django</value></tags><title><value>Architecture of a cloud hosting service using python technologies: django, ansible and celery</value></title></item></items>
